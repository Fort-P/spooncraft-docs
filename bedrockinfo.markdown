## Intro

While Spooncraft is a **Minecraft: Java Edition** server, **Minecraft: Bedrock Edition** players can also join. This allows players on platforms such as consoles, Windows 10, mobile and others to play as well. 

Bedrock support is achieved via [Geyser](https://geysermc.org/), so check it out if you're interested.
{: .notice}

Bedrock support is not currently 100% perfect, but it should be more than good enough at this point for you to be able to play on the server, even if you may run into the occasional issue.

All game mechanics such as redstone will work the way that they do in Java Edition, so keep that in mind when working on projects such as farms that may differ between versions of the game.

## Connecting

Bedrock players can join the server by going to servers, then add server, and connect to one of the Server IPs listed below, leaving the port as default (19132).

**Survival:** `173.233.142.94` \
**Creative Plots:** `173.233.142.2`

**If you're playing on a console,** connecting to the server is a bit more difficult. You can visit [this page]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/consoles/) for instructions.
