On Spooncraft, you can create shops using Universal Shops which protects your shop from stealing, and provides a simple interface for players to buy items from. However, you do not have to use this system if you don't want to.

If you are having any problems with this, you can let us know in **#spooncraft-help** on discord and we will try to help you out :P

## Part 1: Creating the shop

1. Craft a Trade Shop using the following recipe:
![recipe]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/shoptutorial/recipe.png){: .align-center}
2. Place it either on top of or next to a chest.

## Part 2: Setting up the shopkeeper

1. Place items you want to sell inside the chest.
![chest]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/shoptutorial/chest.png){: .align-center}
2. Right click on the Trade Shop and change Price Type to Item, then click on the empty slot to the right.

3. Then, either place the item to use as currency in the empty slot, or click the slot to choose an item. You can then choose the amount.

4. Change Stock Type to either Any Stack or Equal Item. For Equal Item, follow the same process as above, but for the item you are selling.
5. Customers can then right click on the Trade Shop to buy items.
