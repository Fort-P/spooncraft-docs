These are some common questions about the server. Before asking for help, it might be worth checking if your question is answered here.

If you can't find the answer to your question, feel free to ask it in **#in-game-help**!
{: .notice}

## General

### What is the server IP?

We have two servers available for you to play on. We have the Spooncraft survival server and a creative plot world server.

**Spooncraft survival:** `mc.thatmumbojumbo.com` \
**Creative Plot world:** `creative.thatmumbojumbo.com`

You need to have completed the whitelist process to be able to get on either of these servers.

### Is Spooncraft like Hermitcraft?

We want the server to have a similar feel to Hermitcraft, except there will be a lot more players, hence the reason for some of the protection... but in essence yes!

It's a simple survival server where we can work together to make some things on an epic scale!

If you are new to the server and want to get involved in a community project, just ask around, there are lots of projects going on.

### I'm unsure about something, what should I do?

If you are unsure about anything at all, whether it be; where to build, how to make a claim, how something works, etc.... Ask the community!

The community generally have a pretty good idea of how things work, but if you don't understand or want some more clarification (especially if it's a rule you aren't sure on) ask one of the staff members. Not all Discord staff play on the server, but they will certainly be able to point you into the right direction to somebody that can help... All the staff members are pretty friendly.

And remember... there is no such thing as a stupid question!

### Will Mumbo ever play on the server?

Sorry to crush your hopes... but probably not...

He has logged in before to play an April Fools prank, but it's certainly not a regular thing.

He is a pretty busy guy, and playing on the Hermitcraft server actually pays for his life.

### How do I start? What do I do?

Once you are whitelisted and logged into the Spooncraft server, find yourself a decent location away from spawn and start building! It's that simple.

If you are looking for more of a community feel, ask around if there are any towns that you could settle into, or get to work on building a shop in one of the shopping districts.

### Does the End get reset?

No!

We will not be resetting the end; people are building in the end.

### Can I stream/record on the spooncraft server?

Of course you can!

We even allow you to advertise your stream or video, but only in **#spooncraft-videos**.

Please bear in mind though that you may only post videos/streams of you playing on the Spooncraft server only.

It is not a place for you to advertise your channel. You can check the rules for posting videos in **#spooncraft-videos** channel description.

### Can I build a Redstone farm?

Yes, you can, but please keep them as lag free as possible! Ideally, they should only be activated when they are in use, so maybe use a pressure plate to activate them? If they appear to be slowing down the server, the staff may ask you to remove the farm.

## Land Claims

### How do I claim land?

To claim land, you need a [claim scroll]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/craftingrecipes/#claim-scroll). To create a claim, right click on a block to set your first point, and then right click again on another block to set your second point.

After doing this you should be able to see a visual representation of your claim.

### I don't have enough claim blocks!

You will gain an additional 150 claim blocks for each hour that you play, up to a limit of 500,000 blocks (around a 700 x 700 area). Please keep in mind that you can have multiple claims in various locations, but you will still only ever have a maximum of 500,000 claim blocks to use globally.

### How do I remove a claim?

Stand in your claim and run the command:

`/flan delete`

If you want to abandon all your claims, run the command:

`/flan deleteAll`

Please note this cannot be undone unless you reclaim your area.

### Will I ever lose my claim?

Yes!

If you are inactive for 90 days (don't log into the server) all of your claimed land will be open to the public again, your builds will not be removed though.

If you have accrued the maximum number of claim blocks (500,000) then you're safe! You will not lose any of your claims.

### How do I allow people to build on my claim?

You can allow other players to build/access chests/use redstone on your claimed land. To do this, use the command `/flan menu` and click on Edit Global Permissions.

If you want to restrict it to just certain players, go to Edit Permission Groups, then create a group or use one of the existing ones. To see the players in the group and add/remove them, left click the group and to edit permissions for the group, right click the group.

### Why are pistons exploding when I try to use them?

If a piston is activated on the edge of a claim, it will explode - this is to prevent people from using pistons to grief in a claim. To solve the issue, either expand your claim over it or remove the claim. You can also enable the Piston Border permission in the claim to prevent this from happening.

## Map

### How do I access the map?

You can view the map [here](http://173.233.142.94:8080/).

## Shopping

### How do I make a shop on the server?

We're using the Universal Shops mod for shops on the server, although you do have the option to use the trust system if you'd like to.
