## General server info

At the moment we are playing on the SMPEarth map, which is like a normal survival map but with the layout being like the real world at a 1:3000 scale. (Usually we just play on a regular survival world, but we're trying some different things while we wait for the caves and cliffs update)

Here's a list of most things you need to know, like changes from plugins and datapacks:
- You can use flint with an **armor stand** to edit it (right click away from it to change settings, right click on it to apply).
- You can **create shops** using the shopkeepers plugin, you can view a tutorial [here](/shoptutorial/).
- Discord chat is linked to the ingame chat, through the #in-game-chat channel, so you can talk ingame and have it appear in discord, and the other way around.
- We have a **one player sleep** plugin, which will speed up the night when one person is sleeping, and speed it up more for each person who sleeps at the same time.
- You can create nether portals of **any shape**, instead of just rectangular ones.
- There are a few crafting changes, including **double stairs, cheaper tnt, universal dyeing and elytra crafting** (recipe pinned in #in-game-help).  Alternatively, you can also get elytra by killing the dragon again and of course the normal way.
- **PvP** is disabled by default, but if you want to opt in to PvP then you can do so via the website by going to your profile.
- There is a **proximity voice chat** system available, mainly as a test for now. Just to be clear, this is **completely optional** and you will still be able to join the server without it, but if you want to try it out then please take a look at the tutorial [here](/proximitychat/) which will help you set it up.

## MC Earth

- When you first join, you will be able to `/warp` to a continent of your choice. However, you'll only be able to do this **3 times total** so choose carefully!
- Powered rails are now much, much faster when placed above a **redstone block**. Additionally, you now get `64` rails instead of `16` when crafting, and `32` powered rails instead of `6`.
- There is a **separate world** available for gathering resources, so you don't have to destroy the main map. You can teleport to it with `/resourceworld` and to get back use `/earth`. This world can be reset without notice so I would advise against building there or leaving anything behind.
- When going across the world border, you will be teleported to the other side of the map, which should hopefully make travelling a bit easier. You should be able to just walk over the edge and it will teleport you.

## Gold Farm Guidelines
- Raysworks design is not allowed
- Donut designs are allowed, as long as they have a direct line to the center from any part of the donut
- Look at newer designs, ideally want to avoid designs that involve too much pathfinding. Instead, look for designs that give piglins multiple paths to where they need to go
- Jam can review any designs that are being considered
