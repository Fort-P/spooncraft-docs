## General server info

Here's a list of most things you need to know, like changes from plugins and datapacks:
- The **armor statues book** is available to edit armor stands.
- You can **create shops** using the shopkeepers plugin, you can view a tutorial [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/shoptutorial/).
- Discord chat is linked to the ingame chat, through the #in-game-chat channel, so you can talk ingame and have it appear in discord, and the other way around.
- Only one player needs to sleep to skip the night, and a message will appear in chat allowing sleeping to be cancelled if anyone needs it to be night.
- You can create nether portals of **any shape**, instead of just rectangular ones.
- There are a few crafting changes, which are all listed [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/craftingrecipes/).
- **PvP** is disabled by default, but if you want to opt in to PvP then you can do so via the reaction roles in **#server-info**.
- **Powered rails** will make minecarts go much faster when placed above **packed ice**, and even faster when placed above **blue ice**. **Obsidian** will slow them down.
- **Proximity voice chat** is available (java only), using the [Simple Voice Chat]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/proximitychat/) mod. Also, talking in voice chat will activate sculk sensors.
- There are multiple **custom music discs**, see if you can collect them all!
- **Mini blocks** can be obtained from Wandering Traders.
- The **Thunder Shrine** allows you to offer a nether star to create a thunder storm.

## Gold Farm Guidelines
- Raysworks design is not allowed
- Donut designs are allowed, as long as they have a direct line to the center from any part of the donut
- Look at newer designs, ideally want to avoid designs that involve too much pathfinding. Instead, look for designs that give piglins multiple paths to where they need to go
- Jam can review any designs that are being considered
